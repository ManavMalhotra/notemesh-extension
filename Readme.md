# NoteMesh Extension
NoteMesh Extension is a powerful tool designed to work seamlessly with our main NoteMesh web application. It operates as a side panel, allowing users to take notes directly from the webpage they are currently viewing. Users can simultaneously take notes using a Notion-like note editor, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
